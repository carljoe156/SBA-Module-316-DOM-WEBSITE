| **Requirement**                                                                  | **Weight** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Cache at least one element using `getElementById`.**                           | 5%         |
| **Cache at least one element using `querySelector` or `querySelectorAll`.**      | 5%         |
| **Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements**       | **5%**     |
| (e.g., `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `parentNode`, `nextElementSibling`).           |            |
| **Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.**               | 10%        |
| **Create at least one element using `createElement`.**                           | 5%         |
| **Use `appendChild` and/or `prepend` to add new elements to the DOM.**           | 5%         |
| **Use the `DocumentFragment` interface or HTML templating with `cloneNode`.**    | **2%**     |
| **Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user**  | **10%**    |
| interaction using `innerHTML`, `innerText`, or `textContent`.                    |            |
| **Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user**        | **5%**     |
| interactions using the `style` or `classList` properties.                        |            |
| **Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.** | 3%         |
| **Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated**    | **10%**    |
| event handler functions.                                                         |            |
| **Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.**           | 3%         |
| **Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.**       | 5%         |
| **Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation.**      | **5%**     |
| (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-  |            |
| based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)                  |            |
| **Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not**  | 10%        |
| work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).         |            |
| **Commit frequently to the git repository.**                                     | 5%         |
| **Include a README file that contains a description of your application.**       | 2%         |
| **Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.**  | **5%**     |
